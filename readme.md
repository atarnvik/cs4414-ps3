Zhttanalyze:

The purpose of zhttanalyze is to take a textfile list of IP addresses generated by zhtta and determine the physical locations were requests are originating from.

in order to compile zhttanalyze, one must link it with the rust-http crate. 

I've included the version of rust-http that is compatible with rustc 0.9 in the folder. To compile zhttanalyze.rs, one must run:
	rustc zhttanalyze.rs -L ../rust-http/build

To run zhttanalyze, one must provide a textfile input which is a list of IP addresses with ports generated by our version of Zhtta.

In this folder I've included iplogtest.txt, which has a set of sample address that are valid IP addresses that aren't 127.0.0..1 (which will just display as "internal" in the program).

So to run zhttanalyze on iplogtest.txt, run:

	./zhttanalyze iplogtest.txt
